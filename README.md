## School Management System

The school management system is an application that allows small academies manage and organize 
all the students, teachers and classes information in one single application. 
The application will allow teachers to set grades, register and set absences for each student,
as well as be a platform where students can check in their grades and register or drop classes.

I was inspired to create this application as during my last volunteer as a math teacher in a chess academy, I notice 
that they did not have a good system for tracking attendance, nor to track the classes they were teaching. This due to
the cost it implies the construction of one of those sites as well as its maintenance. This project will allow all 
this starting academies have a **reliable**, **free** and **easy** system to track all their information.
